I am a research asssociate at NYU Grossman School of Medicine Deparment of Radiology working on cardiac MRI research. I recently graduated from NYU Courant with a MS in computer science in 2024. I am interested in generative models, optimal transport, differential geometry and AI for Science. In a previous life, I spent time as a reporter at a business magazine in NY convering macroeconomics, tech companies and US-Asia. I also studied interational relations and economics at Johns Hopkins University.
